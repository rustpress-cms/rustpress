## Known differences

- **The compat run uses RustPress without allow_writes, so sign-in and wp-admin stay closed; XML-RPC and wp-cron.php do not exist. Sign-in and wp-admin are compared with their own scripts in dev/ (login-compare.sh, admin-compare.sh and others).**: `/wp-login.php` (status), `/wp-login.php` (header:link), `/wp-admin/` (status), `/wp-admin/` (header:location), `/wp-admin/` (header:link), `/xmlrpc.php` (status), `/xmlrpc.php` (header:content-type), `/xmlrpc.php` (header:cache-control), `/xmlrpc.php` (header:expires), `/xmlrpc.php` (header:link), `/xmlrpc.php` (header:allow), `/wp-cron.php` (status) … and 2 more
- **The route index at /wp-json/ lists only the routes RustPress serves itself (a subset).**: `/wp-json/` (bytes)
- **The reference on port 8080 loses the port when canonicalizing (a WordPress quirk) and so does not redirect ?feed=…; RustPress redirects to /feed/ like WordPress does on a standard port.**: `/?feed=rss2` (status), `/?feed=rss2` (header:content-type), `/?feed=rss2` (header:location), `/?feed=rss2` (header:etag), `/?feed=rss2` (header:last-modified), `/?feed=rss2` (header:link)
- **RustPress deliberately sends Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400 for static files; the reference's Apache sends none.**: `/wp-includes/js/dist/script-modules/interactivity/index.min.js?ver=efaa5193bbad9c60ffd1` (header:cache-control), `/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.min.js?ver=3.7.1` (header:cache-control), `/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery-migrate.min.js?ver=3.4.1` (header:cache-control), `/wp-content/uploads/2026/10/building-exterior.webp` (header:cache-control), `/wp-includes/images/smilies/mrgreen.png` (header:cache-control), `/wp-content/uploads/2026/10/building-exterior-150x150.webp` (header:cache-control), `/wp-content/uploads/2026/10/wordpress-logo.png` (header:cache-control), `/wp-includes/js/dist/script-modules/block-library/navigation/view.min.js?ver=1bf28ded04f9f188bdcb` (header:cache-control), `/wp-includes/js/mediaelement/mediaelement-and-player.min.js?ver=4.2.17` (header:cache-control), `/wp-includes/js/mediaelement/mediaelement-migrate.min.js?ver=7.1.3` (header:cache-control), `/wp-includes/js/mediaelement/wp-mediaelement.min.js?ver=7.1.3` (header:cache-control), `/wp-includes/js/mediaelement/renderers/vimeo.min.js?ver=4.2.17` (header:cache-control) … and 2 more

Listed, but not seen in this run:

- `^/wp-sitemap-posts-post-9999[.]xml$` (bytes): The 404 page of a missing sitemap differs from WordPress only in whitespace in the head.
- `^/category/uncategorized/page/2/$` (body): Posts with exactly the same date (here gleich-a/gleich-b) have no defined order in MariaDB; it depends on the query plan and can differ between WordPress and RustPress.
- `^/[?]rest_route=/$` (bytes): The route index lists only the routes RustPress serves itself (a subset).
- `^/(robots[.]txt|favicon[.]ico)$` (*): Without permalink rules WordPress does not know these files and redirects /robots.txt to /robots.txt/ (a quirk of plain permalinks); RustPress answers 404.
- `^/wp-content/uploads/` (*): The reference copy of the real site does not have its uploaded files (they stay with the site owner); without the file the two sides answer differently.
